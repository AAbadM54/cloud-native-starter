## Building and deploy the Containers

****** **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** ******

In this Lab we build and deploy the containers with microservices to Kubernetes.

Along this way we inspect the **Dockerfiles** for the container images and we take a look into the configured **yaml files** to create the **deployment** and setup the right **ISTIO configuration** for the microservices.

The following diagram shows a high level overview of steps which will be automated later with bash scripts.

1. Uploading container definition
2. Building and storing of theproduction container image inside the IBM Cloud Registry
3. Deploying the containers into the Kuberentes Cluster

## Containers

### Dockerfile to create the articles container

Now we take a look into the [Dockerfile](../articles-java-jee/Dockerfile.nojava) to create the articles service. The inside the Dockerfile we use multiple stages to build the  container image. 
The reason for the two stages we have the objective to be independed on local environment settings, when we create the container. With this concept we don't have to ensure that Java and Maven (or wrong versions) installed.

* Build environment container

Here we create our **build environment container** based on the maven 3.5 image from the [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven/).

```
FROM maven:3.5-jdk-8 as BUILD
COPY src /usr/src/app/src
COPY pom.xml /usr/src/app
```

Let's build the **articles.war** inside the container image, using the maven command **mvn -f pom.xml clean package** .

```
RUN mvn -f /usr/src/app/pom.xml clean package
```

* Production container

Here we create the **production container** based on the **openliberty** with **microProfile2**.
Then **zipkintracer** will be installed.

```
FROM openliberty/open-liberty:microProfile2-java8-openj9
ADD liberty-opentracing-zipkintracer-1.2-sample.zip /
RUN unzip liberty-opentracing-zipkintracer-1.2-sample.zip -d /opt/ol/wlp/usr/ \
 && rm liberty-opentracing-zipkintracer-1.2-sample.zip
COPY liberty/server.xml /config/
```

Now it is time to copy the build result **articles.war** form our **build environment container** into the correct place inside the **production container**.

```
COPY --from=BUILD /usr/src/app/target/articles.war /config/dropins/
```
### Dockerfile to create the web-api container

The web-api [Dockerfile](../web-apo-java-jee/Dockerfile.nojava) to create the web-api service, works in the same way as for **articles container**. Inside the Dockerfile we use the same multiple stages to build the container image as in the for the **articles container**. 



## Deploy the container to the Kubernetes Cluster

Invoke the following commands to set up the Java based microservice 'articles':

```
$ cd $PROJECT_HOME
$ scripts/check-prerequisites.sh
$ scripts/delete-all.sh
$ scripts/deploy-articles-java-jee.sh
$ scripts/show-urls.sh
```

Invoke the curl command which is displayed as output of 'scripts/show-urls.sh' to get ten articles.
