# Introduction

As part of this workshop, we will see how to develop cloud-native microservices using Jakarta EE and MicroProfile, which are deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, and Istio.
We'll examine the basics of modern Enterprise Java services, as well as container, rest APIS, traffic management, and resiliency.


## Example application

Our microservices example consists of TBD.

### Services

**Articles microservice**

The objective of this microservice is to add and get artical information from a database. At moment the implementation is just creating sample data values.

The service is organized in following packages:

* apis
* business
* data

**Web-api microservice**

The objective of this microservice is to combine information from different services and provide that information to be consumned using a REST api in the vue webapp. In this case the information of **articals** and **authors** are combined to be consunmed by the webapp.

This microservice also organized in following packages:

* apis
* business
* data
