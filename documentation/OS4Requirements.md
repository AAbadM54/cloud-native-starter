# Requirements for Cloud Native Starter on OpenShift

If you haven't already done so get the code from GitHub:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/cloud-native-starter.git
$ cd cloud-native-starter
$ ROOT_FOLDER=$(pwd) 
```

Check if you already have a copy of `local.env`:

```
$ cat local.env
```

If the file doesn't exist, create it:

```
$ cp template.local.env local.env 
```

## Required Tools

We will use scripts to install our microservices. You need to have these tools locally installed on your workstation:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) 
* [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
* [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/)
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) requires not only the code but also permission to run docker commands
* `oc`

    Using OpenShift from the command line and in scripts requires the `oc` CLI. In the OpenShift web console (e.g. with `crc console`) you can find the download link for different operating systems in the Help menu in the upper right corner:

    ![Get oc CLI](../images/get-oc-cli.png)

**Note:** Docker always needs to be installed locally. 

The tools git, curl and kubectl (and ibmcloud) can be installed locally or you can use a [Docker image](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-native-starter/blob/master/workshop-one-service/1-prereqs.md#tools) that comes with these tools. Using the Docker image is an **option for Windows users** since many of our scripts will not run unmodified on Windows.

```
$ cd ${ROOT_FOLDER}
$ docker run -v $ROOT_FOLDER/:/cloud-native-starter -it --rm ibmcom/ibm-cloud-developer-tools-amd64
```

## Access OpenShift via CLI

1. Access the OpenShift Web Console
2. In the upper right corner, click on the name of the logged in user (e.g. kube:admin), then click on "Copy Login Command"
3. If required, log in again, then click "Display Token"
4. Open the file 'local.env' (created in the very beginning of this document)
5. From the "Display Token" page, copy
   * the API token to APITOKEN in local.env
   * the server URL from the Log in command to OS4SERVER in local.env

   ![Display Token](../images/displaytoken.png)
   
   Save the local.env, it should now look similar to this:

   ![OS4 local.env](../images/os4-localenv.png)

## Access the OpenShift Internal Image Repository

You have to store the container images for the applications you want to deploy on Kubernetes/OpenShift in a place where they can be accessed during the rollout of an application. This can be Docker Hub, the IBM Container Registry, Quay.io, or any other repository on the Internet you have access to. It can also be the internal repository running within OpenShift.

For this project we will use the internal registry. We will build our images locally on your workstation, then tag them with a name for the internal repository, and then push them into the internal repository. Logon to the repository is not sufficient, though. The `docker` CLI will refuse to connect with a x509 error about an unknown certificate.

First, we have to obtain the CA certificate from OpenShift.

Execute these commands, they require that you created the local.env file in the previous step:

```
$ source local.env
$ oc login --token=$APITOKEN --server=$OS4SERVER
$ oc extract secret/router-ca --keys=tls.crt -n openshift-ingress-operator
```

This will extract the CA certificate from OpenShift and store it in file tls.crt on your workstation.

The following are the steps to add the OpenShift certificate to Docker. They differ between operating systems. 

#### Linux

Thanks to Sandip Gupta, IBM, for pointing this out on [CRC Github Issues](https://github.com/code-ready/crc/issues/775).

Execute these commands:

```
$ sudo mkdir -p  /etc/docker/certs.d/default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing/
$ sudo cp tls.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing/
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
```

I am running Fedora, the last command to restart the Docker daemon may be different on your distribution.

#### Mac

You can find these instructions at [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#adding-tls-certificates](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#adding-tls-certificates).

To manually add a custom, self-signed certificate, start by adding the certificate to the macOS keychain, which is picked up by Docker Desktop. Execute this command:

```
$ sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain tls.crt
```

Or, if you prefer to add the certificate to your own local keychain only (rather than for all users), run this command instead:

```
$ security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain tls.crt
```

You need to restart Docker Desktop after making any changes in order for the changes to take effect.

#### Windows

If you are using the Docker image as suggested in the "Required Tools" section above, just follow the instructions for Linux.

If you are running everything locally on Windows please note: I have no access to a Windows workstation running Docker Desktop, but I found these instructions:

[https://success.docker.com/article/how-to-install-dtr-ca-on-windows](https://success.docker.com/article/how-to-install-dtr-ca-on-windows)

I believe that step "1. Get necessary CA certificate" is equivalent to "oc extract secret/router-ca --keys=tls.crt -n openshift-ingress-operator" in the instructions above.

## Get access with `docker` CLI

1. In the OpenShift Web Console, go to "Administrator", "Home", "Projects". 
2. Search for and open project 'openshift-image-registry'.
3. Go to the "Workloads" tab.
4. Click on "image-registry" in the list
5. Open the "Resources" tab
6. Copy the location of the default route

![os-image-registry](../images/os-image-registry.png)

Paste the default route URL into REGISTRYURL in local.env but omit the "https://" part:

```
REGISTRYURL=default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing
```

Don't forget to save local.env!

Now test the access:

```
$ source local.env
$ docker login -u developer -p $(oc whoami -t) $REGISTRYURL
```

This should result in a few warnings and in the end show "Login Succeeded".
